## Repository for : Deep learning Optical interferometry extracting spatial/temporal correlations of in vivo eye cells
The following work aims to create a learning-based, interpretable image analysis tool for complex inter-correlated signals. While we will focus on FFOCT eyes images, the results can be generalized to other types of complex images. Both raw physical images and computer-simulated data are used in this work to understand the capabilities and limitations of the data-driven decomposition. 


The testing, depending on the task, is carried out on ex vivo and in vivo optical tomographic data from the heathy subjects and clinical patients.
The first task of our work is to exploit the correlated signals of FFOCT images for denoising.\
The code, as well as data example, can be found in ths repository.


# An early preprint of this work will be uploaded soon.
